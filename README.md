# Open Mic+ for Google Now
Trigger Google Now on Anrdoid with a custom hotword, by waving your hand, or by shaking your phone

Details of the app are on the website: http://openmic.rsenapps.com/
This app had 4,000,000+ Downloads on the Google Play Store, but Google has once again removed it from the store.

This app has not been updated in a couple of years and I don't have to the time or interest in keeping it up to date, but hopefully by opensourcing this project, someone else will be able to make use of the code or continue maintaining it!

Please feel free to reach out if you have questions about how the project works.
