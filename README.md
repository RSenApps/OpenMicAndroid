# Open Mic+ for Google Now
Trigger Google Now on Anrdoid with a custom hotword, by waving your hand, or by shaking your phone

This app had 4,000,000+ Downloads on the Google Play Store, but Google has once again removed it from the store.

This app has not been updated in a couple of years and I don't have to the time or interest in keeping it up to date, but hopefully by opensourcing this project, someone else will be able to make use of the code or continue maintaining it!

Please feel free to reach out if you have questions about how the project works.


## Original Description:
<b>As Featured on XDA, LifeHacker, SlashGear, Android Community, Android Headlines, Droid Life, Phone Arena, Android Spin, dotTech, AndroidInt'l, and more!</b>

Google Now, Everywhere.

With Open Mic+ for Google Now, access all the commands from anywhere on your phone, while driving, or while away from your phone! Simply say "Okay Google", wave your hand, or shake your phone. Screen on, screen off Google Now will be ready to listen. 

### WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
Google Now becomes more conversational as after a search just say Okay Google to start a new one. And even better get the answers to your questions while your hands are tied, or when you're on the couch, or in the car.

### TOMORROW'S FEATURES TODAY
Everybody's talking about the new Touchless Controls features for the Moto X, but now any phone that is running Jelly Bean or higher can have the same experience.

### SEAMLESS
Open Mic+ will run in the background and can be configured to start at boot so that it truly becomes part of the phone.

### TASKER INTEGRATION
Truly automate your device by combining the endless command list of Tasker with the ease of access of Open Mic!

### CHANGE YOUR HOT PHRASE
With Open Mic+ you aren’t limited to “Okay Google”. Live out your sci-fi fantasies, support your favorite team, and just feel awesome with complete control over your phone.
